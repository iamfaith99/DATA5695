# McDonald Chapter 11 Binomial Option Pricing: :Selected Topics 

## Understanding Early Exercise

<br>

- Options may be rationally exercised prior to expiration
- By exercising, the option holder
  - Receives the stock and thus receives dividends
  - Pays the strike price prior to expiration (this has an interest cost)
  - Loses the insurance implicit in the call against the possibility that the stock price will be less than the strike price at expiration


## Understanding Early Exercise

- If volatility is zero, the value of insurance is zero. Then, it is optimal to defer exercise as long as interest savings on the strike exceed dividends lost

$$
rK > \delta S
$$

- Therefore, it is optimal to exercise when

$$
S > \frac{rK}{\delta}
$$

- *NB:* in the special case when $r = \delta$ and $\sigma = 0$, any ITM option should be exercised immediately

- When volatility is positive, the implicit insurance has value that varies with time to expiration

## Understanding Early Exercise (Cont'd)

- The following graph displays the price, above which early exercise is optimal for a 5-year call option with $K =\$100$, $r = 5\%$, and $\delta = 5\%$

## Understanding Risk-Neutral Pricing

<br>

- A risk-neutral investor is indifferent between a sure thing and a risky bet with an expected payoff equal to the value of the sure thing

- $p^{\ast}$ is the risk-neutral probability that the stock price will go up 


## Understanding Risk-Neutral Pricing (Cont'd)

<br>

- The option pricing formula can be said to price options as if investors are risk-neutral

- Note that we are not assuming that investors are actually risk-neutral, and that risky assets are actually expected to earn the risk-free rate of return

<br>

- ***Just that a world of perfect synthetic replication and costless/frictionless arbitrage is isomorphic to such a world!***

## Pricing an Option Using Real Probabilities

<br>

- Is option pricing consistent with standard discounted cash flow calculations?

- Yes! However, discounted cash flow is not used in practice to price options

- This is because it is necessary to compute the option price in order to compute the correct discount rate
