# McDonald Chapter 11 Binomial Option Pricing: Selected Topics 


# Understanding Early Exercise 

## Understanding Early Exercise

<br>

- Options may be rationally exercised prior to expiration
- By exercising, the option holder
  - Receives the stock and thus receives dividends
  - Pays the strike price prior to expiration (this has an interest cost)
  - Loses the insurance implicit in the call against the possibility that the stock price will be less than the strike price at expiration


## Understanding Early Exercise

- If volatility is zero, the value of insurance is zero. Then, it is optimal to defer exercise as long as interest savings on the strike exceed dividends lost

$$
rK > \delta S
$$

- Therefore, it is optimal to exercise when

$$
S > \frac{rK}{\delta}
$$

- *NB:* in the special case when $r = \delta$ and $\sigma = 0$, any ITM option should be exercised immediately

- When volatility is positive, the implicit insurance has value that varies with time to expiration

## Understanding Early Exercise (Cont'd)

- The following graph displays the price, above which early exercise is optimal for a 5-year call option with $K =\$100$, $r = 5\%$, and $\delta = 5\%$

# Understanding Risk-Neutral Pricing

## Understanding Risk-Neutral Pricing

<br>

- A **risk-neutral** investor is indifferent between a sure thing and a risky bet with an expected payoff equal to the value of the sure thing

- $p^{\ast}$ is the risk-neutral probability that the stock price will go up 


## Understanding Risk-Neutral Pricing (Cont'd)

<br>

- The option pricing formula can be said to price options ***as if*** investors are risk-neutral

- Note that we are not assuming that investors are actually risk-neutral, and that risky assets are actually expected to earn the risk-free rate of return

<br>

- ***Just that a world of perfect synthetic replication and costless/frictionless arbitrage is isomorphic to such a world!***

## Pricing an Option Using Real Probabilities

<br>

- Is option pricing consistent with standard discounted cash flow calculations?

- Yes! However, discounted cash flow is not used in practice to price options

- This is because it is necessary to compute the option price in order to compute the correct discount rate


## Pricing an Option Using Real Probabilities (cont'd)

<br>

- Suppose that the continuously compounded expected return on the stock is $\alpha$ and that the stock does not pay dividends

- If $p$ is the true probability of the stock going up, $p$ must be consistent with $u, d$, and $\alpha$

$$
puS + (1-p)dS = e^{\alpha h} S
$$

- Solving for $p$ gives us

$$
p = \frac{e^{\alpha h} - d}{u - d}
$$


## Pricing an Option Using Real Probabilities (cont'd)

<br>

- Using $p$, the actual expected payoff to the option one period hence is

$$
pC_{u} + (1-p)C_{d} = \frac{e^{\alpha h} - d}{u - d}C_{u} + \frac{u - e^{\alpha h}}{u - d}C_{d}
$$

- At what rate do we discount this expected payoff?
  - It is not correct to discount the option at the expected return on the stock, $\alpha$, because the option is equivalent to a leveraged investment in the stock and hence is riskier than the stock


## Pricing an Option Using Real Probabilities (cont'd)

<br>

- Denote the appropriate per-period discount rate for the option as $\gamma$

- Since an option is equivalent to holding a portfolio consisting of $\Delta$ shares of stock and $B$ bonds, the expected return on this portfolio is

$$
e^{\gamma h} = \frac{S \Delta}{S \Delta + B} e^{\alpha h} + \frac{B}{S \Delta + B} e^{r h}
$$

<br>

* **NB:** this is like a WACC for the option contract. 
  

## Pricing an Option Using Real Probabilities (cont'd)

<br>

- We can now compute the option price as the expected option payoff, equation(11.5), discounted at the appropriate discount rate, given by equation (11.6). This gives

$$
C = e^{-\gamma h} \left[\frac{e^{\alpha h} - d}{u - d} C_{u} + \frac{u - e^{\alpha h}}{u - d} C_{d} \right]
$$


## Pricing an Option Using Real Probabilities (cont'd)

<br>

- It turns out that this gives us the same option price as performing the risk-neutral calculation

  - Note that it does not matter whether we have the "correct" value of $\alpha$ to start with

  - Any consistent pair of $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ will give the same option price

  - Risk-neutral pricing is valuable because setting $\alpha = r$ results in the simplest pricing procedure.


# One-Period Numerical Example


## One-Period Numerical Example (Figure 11.3, p. 328)

<br>

- Let $\alpha = 15\%$ per annum (just pulled out of your finger!)

- Let $S = \$41.0$, $K = \$40.0$, $r = 8\%$ per annum, $\sigma = 30\%$ per annum, $\delta = 0$, and $T = 1$ year


## One-Period Example (Cont'd)

<br>

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true

import numpy as np
S, K, r, v, q, T, n = 41.0, 40.0, 0.08, 0.30, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0
h = T / n

u = np.exp((r - q)*h + v*np.sqrt(h))
d = np.exp((r - q)*h - v*np.sqrt(h))
u, d
```


## One-Period Example (Cont'd) 

<br>

The "true" or "physical" probability is then:

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true

a = 0.15
p = (np.exp(a*h) - d)/ (u - d)
p
```

<br>

The option payoffs at expiry are:

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true

Cu = np.maximum(u*S - K, 0.0)
Cd = np.maximum(d*S - K, 0.0)
Cu, Cd
```


## One-Period Example (Cont'd) 

<br>

The expected option payoff at expiry under the physical density is:

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true

CT_hat = p*Cu + (1.0 - p)*Cd
CT_hat
```

<br>

**Q:** But how to get its present value? We cannot use $r$!


## One-Period Example (Cont'd) 

<br>

The option weighted-average cost of capital (or risky discount rate):

- $\Delta$ and $B$ do not depend upon $\alpha$ or $p$:
  
```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true

D = np.exp(-q * h) * ((Cu - Cd) / (u*S - d*S))
B = np.exp(-r * h) * ((u*Cd - d*Cu) / (u - d))
D, B
```

<br>

So now we can compute the portfolio weights:

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true

w1 = (D*S) / (D*S + B)
w2 = B / (D*S + B) 

wacc = w1*np.exp(a*h) + w2*np.exp(r*h)
wacc

gamma = np.log(wacc)
gamma
```



## One-Period Example (Cont'd) 

<br>

So with $\gamma$ in hand, we can now take the present value:

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true

C0 = np.exp(-gamma*h) * CT_hat
C0
```

<br>

**NB:** This is the same answer we got with both the no-arbitrage and risk-neutral forms of the model


# The Binomial Tree and Lognormality

## The Binomial Tree and Lognormality

<br>

- The usefulness of the binomial pricing model hinges on the binomial tree providing a reasonable representation of the stock price distribution

- The binomial tree approximates a lognormal distribution


## The Random Walk Model

<br>

- It is sometimes said that stock prices follow a random walk

- Imagine that we flip a coin repeatedly

  - Let the random variable $Y$ denote the outcome of the flip

  - If the coin lands displaying a head, $Y = 1$; otherwise, $Y = -1$

  - If the probability of a head is $50\%$, we say the coin is fair

  - After $n$ flips, with the $i^{\text{th}}$ flip denoted $Y_{i}$, the cumulative total, $Z_{n}$, is

$$
Z_{n} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_{i}
$$

- It turns out that the more times we flip, on average the farther we will move from where we start


## The Random Walk Model (cont'd)

<br>

- We can represent the process followed by $Z_{n}$ in term of the change in $Z_{n}$

$$
Z_{n} - Z_{n-1} = Y_{n} \\
$$

<br>

$$
\begin{align}
\text{Heads:} \quad & Z_{n} - Z_{n-1} = +1 \\
\text{Tails:} \quad & Z_{n} - Z_{n-1} = -1
\end{align}
$$


## The Random Walk Model (cont'd)

- A random walk, where with heads, the change in $Z$ is 1, and with tails, the change in $Z$ is $-1$

## Simulating a Binomial Random Walk Process

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 

# Simulate the coin flips
X = 2 * np.random.binomial(n=1, p=0.5, size=100_000) - 1
Z = np.cumsum(X)
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
# Figure for Random Walk
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))
plt.plot(Z, lw=1)
plt.title("Cumulative Z (Random Walk)")
plt.xlabel("Number of coin flips")
plt.ylabel("Z")
plt.grid(True)  # turn on both horizontal and vertical grid lines
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## Simulating Binomial Prices

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
S, r, v, T, N, h = 100.0, 0.06, 0.30, 1.0, 10_000, 0.0001
u = np.exp(r*h + v*np.sqrt(h))
d = np.exp(r*h - v*np.sqrt(h))
p_star = (np.exp(r*h) - d) / (u - d)
y, y[0] = np.random.choice([u, d], p=[p_star, 1.0 - p_star], size=N+1), S
spot = np.cumprod(y) 
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
# Figure for Random Walk
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))
plt.plot(spot, lw=1)
plt.title("Stock Price")
plt.xlabel("Time (years)")
plt.ylabel("Dollars ($)")
plt.grid(True)  # turn on both horizontal and vertical grid lines
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```


## The Random Walk Model (cont'd)

<br>

- The idea that asset prices should follow a random walk was articulated in Samuelson (1965)
  - [Proof That Properly Anticipated Prices Fluctuate Randomly](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814566926_0002)

- In efficient markets, an asset price should reflect all available information. In response to new information the price is equally likely to move up or down, as with the coin flip

- The price after a period of time is the initial price plus the cumulative up and down movements due to informational surprises


## Modeling Stock Prices As a Random Walk

<br>

- The above description of a random walk is not a satisfactory description of stock price movements. There are at least three problems with this model

  - If by chance we get enough cumulative down movements, the stock price will become negative

  - The magnitude of the move (\$1) should depend upon how quickly the coin flips occur and the level of the stock price

  - The stock, on average, should have a positive return. The random walk model taken literally does not permit this

- The binomial model is a variant of the random walk model that solves all of these problems at once


## The Binomial Model

$$
S_{t+h} = S_{t} e^{(r - \delta)h \pm \sigma\sqrt{h}}
$$

- Taking logs, we obtain

$$
\ln\left(S_{t+h} / S_{t}\right) = (r - \delta)h \pm \sigma\sqrt{h} \quad\quad \text{(11.11)}
$$

  - Since $\ln\left(S_{t+k} / S_{t}\right)$ is the continuously compounded return from $t$ to $t+h$, the binomial model is simply a particular way to model the continuously compounded return

  - That return has two parts:
    - The drift: $(r - \delta) h$ generates the upward trend (all else equal)
    - The diffusion: $\sigma\sqrt{h}$) which is uncertain and generates the up and down moves


## The Binomial Model (cont'd)

<br>

- Equation (11.11) solves the three problems in the random walk

  - The stock price cannot become negative

  - As $h$ gets smaller, up and down moves get smaller

  - There is a $(r-\delta) h$ term, and we can choose the probability of an up move, so we can guarantee that the expected change in the stock price is positive


## Lognormality and the Binomial Model

<br>

- The binomial tree approximates a lognormal distribution, which is commonly used to model stock prices

- The lognormal distribution is the probability distribution that arises from the assumption that continuously compounded returns on the stock are normally distributed

- With the lognormal distribution, the stock price is positive, and the distribution is skewed to the right, that is, there is a chance that extremely high stock prices will occur


## Lognormality and the Binomial Model (cont'd)

- The binomial model implicitly assigns probabilities to the various nodes.

## Is the Binomial Model Realistic?

<br>

- The binomial model is a form of the random walk model, adapted to modeling stock prices. The lognormal random walk model in this section assumes among other things, that
  - Volatility is constant
  - "Large" stock price movements do not occur
  - Returns are independent over time

- All of these assumptions appear to be violated in the data
