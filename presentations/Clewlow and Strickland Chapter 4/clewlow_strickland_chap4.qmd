# Clewlow and Strickland: Chapter 4 Monte Carlo Simulation 

## Valuation by Simulation 

<br>

- We have previously shown that the value of an option is the risk-neutral expectation of its discounted payoff 

- In the binomial model this was seen in the single-period model

$$
C_{0} = e^{-rh}\left[p^{\ast} C_{u} + (1 - p^{\ast})C_{d}\right]
$$

- The term inside the brackets is the binomial expected value under the risk-neutral distribution 

- This suggests a path forward for models beyond the binomial model

- We can obtain an estimate of the risk-neutral expected value by computing the average of a large number of discounted payoffs

- This is a LLN argument based on frequentist reasoning


## Valuation by Simulation (cont'd)

- Consider an European call option that pays $C_{T}$ at expiry. 

- First, we simulate the risk-neutral process of the state variables  from their observed values today

- Second, apply the payoff function to the terminal values simulated along each path and obtain $C_{T,j}$ for path $j$

- Then discount this payoff (assuming a constant risk-free rate):

$$
C_{0,j} = e^{-rT} C_{T,j}
$$

- Repeat this $M$ times and obtain:

$$
\hat{C}_{0} = \frac{1}{M} \sum\limits_{j=1}^{M} C_{0,j}
$$


## Valuation by Simulation (cont'd)

<br>

- This is basically a proposal to evaluate the expectation statistically using Monte Carlo integration

- There will thus be sampling error introduced in the algorithm and we can estimate it via the *standard error* of the simulation 

$$
SE(\hat{C}_{0}) = \frac{SD(C_{0,j})}{\sqrt{M}}
$$

The standard deviation is given by:

$$
\mathrm{SD}\left(C_{0,j}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{M-1} \sum_{j=1}^M\left(C_{0,j} - \hat{C}_0\right)^2\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}
$$
