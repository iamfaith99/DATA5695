# McDonald Chapter 12: The Black-Scholes Formula

## The Black-Scholes Formula 

<br>

- The Black-Scholes formula is a limiting case of the binomial formula (infinitely many periods) for the price of a European option.

- Consider an European call (or put) option written on a stock

- Assume that the stock pays dividend at the continuous rate $\delta$

## Black-Scholes Formula (cont'd)

<br>

- Call Option price

$$
C(S, K, \sigma, r, T, \delta) = Se^{-\delta T} N(d_{1}) - Ke^{-r T} N(d_{2})
$$

- Put Option price

$$
P(S, K, \sigma, r, T, \delta) = Ke^{-r T} N(-d_{2}) - Se^{-\delta T} N(-d_{1})
$$

where

$$
\begin{aligned}
d_{1} & = \frac{\ln(S / K) + (r - \delta + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^{2}) T}{\sigma \sqrt{T}} \\
d_{2} & = d_{1} - \sigma\sqrt{T}
\end{aligned}
$$


## Black-Scholes Assumptions

<br>

- Assumptions about stock return distribution

- Continuously compounded returns on the stock are normally distributed and independent over time (no "jumps")

- The volatility of continuously compounded returns is known and constant

- Future dividends are known, either as dollar amount or as a fixed dividend yield


## Black-Scholes Assumptions (cont'd)

<br>

- Assumptions about the economic environment

- The risk-free rate is known and constant

- There are no transaction costs or taxes

- It is possible to short-sell costlessly and to borrow at the risk-free rate


## Option Greeks

<br>

- What happens to the option price when one and only one input changes?

- Delta ( $\Delta$ ): change in option price when stock price increases by $\$ 1$

- Gamma ( $\Gamma$ ): change in delta when option price increases by $\$ 1$

- Vega: change in option price when volatility increases by $1 \%$

- Theta $(\theta)$ : change in option price when time to maturity decreases by 1 day

- Rho $(\rho)$ : change in option price when interest rate increases by $1 \%$

- Greek measures for portfolios

- The Greek measure of a portfolio is weighted average of Greeks of individual portfolio components

$$
\Delta_{\text{portfolio }} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \omega_{i} \Delta_{i}
$$


## Implied Volatility

<br>

- Volatility is unobservable

- Option prices, particularly for near-the-money options, can be quite sensitive to volatility

- One approach is to compute historical volatility using the history of returns

- A problem with historical volatility is that expected future volatility can be different from historical volatility.

- Alternatively, we can calculate implied volatility, which is the volatility that, when put into a pricing formula (typically Black-Scholes), yields the observed option price.


## Implied Volatility (cont'd)

<br>

- In practice implied volatilities of itm, atm, and out-of-the money options are generally different

- A volatility smile refers to when volatility is symmetric, with volatility lowest for at-themoney options, and high for in-the-money and out-of-the-money options

- A difference in volatilities between in-the-money and out-of-the-money options is referred to as a volatility skew

# Appendices

## Appendix 12.A: The Standard Normal Distribution 

<br>

The *standard normal probability density function* is given by 

$$
\phi(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}x^{2}}
$$

The *cumulative standard normal distribution function*, evaluated at point $x$, for example, tells us the probability that a number randomly drawn from the standard normal distribution will fall below $x$, 1. 

$$
N(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{x} \phi(x)dx \equiv \int_{-\infty}^{x} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}x^{2}} dx 
$$

The `scipy` module in Python computes this as: `scipy.stats.norm.cdf`


## Appendix 12.B: Formulas for Option Greeks 

<br>

### **Delta** ($\Delta$) 

<br>

Delta measures the change in the option price for a $\$1$ change in the spot price: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Call delta } &= \frac{\partial C(S, K, \sigma, r, T - t, \delta)}{\partial S} = e^{-\delta (T - t)} N(d_{1}) \\
\text{Put  delta } &= \frac{\partial P(S, K, \sigma, r, T - t, \delta)}{\partial S} = -e^{-\delta (T - t)} N(-d_{1})
\end{aligned}
$$ 


## Appendix 12.B: Formulas for Option Greeks (cont'd) 

<br>

### **Gamma** ($\Gamma$) 

<br>

Gamma measures the change in delta when the spot price changes:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Call gamma } &= \frac{\partial^{2} C(S, K, \sigma, r, T - t, \delta)}{\partial S^{2}} = \frac{e^{-\delta (T - t)} N^{\prime}(d_{1})}{S\sigma\sqrt{(T - t)}} \\
\text{Put  gamma } &= \text{Call gamma}
\end{aligned}
$$

<br>

The second equation follows from put-call parity.


## Appendix 12.B: Formulas for Option Greeks (cont'd) 

<br>

### **Theta** ($\Theta$)

Theta measures the change in the option price with respect to calendar time $(t)$, holding fixed time to expiration $(T)$ :

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Call theta } &= \frac{\partial C(S, K, \sigma, r, T - t, \delta)}{\partial t} \\
                   &= \delta Se^{-\delta (T - t)} N(d_{1}) - rKe^{-r (T - t)} N(d_{2}) - \frac{Ke^{-r (T - t)} N^{\prime}(d_{2}) \sigma}{2 \sqrt{(T - t)}} \\
\text{Put  theta } &= \frac{\partial P(S, K, \sigma, r, T - t, \delta)}{\partial t} \\
                   &= \text{Call theta } + rKe^{-r (T - t)} - \delta Se^{-\delta (T - t)}
\end{aligned}
$$

If time to expiration is measured in years, theta will be the annualized change in the option value. To obtain a per-day theta, divide by 365.


## Appendix 12.B: Formulas for Option Greeks (cont'd) 

<br>

### **Vega**

<br>

Vega measures the change in the option price when volatility changes. Some writers also use the terms lambda or kappa to refer to this measure:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Call vega } &= \frac{\partial C(S, K, \sigma, r, T - t, \delta)}{\partial \sigma} = Se^{-\delta(T-t)} N^{\prime}(d_{1}) \sqrt{(T - t)} \\
\text{Put  vega } &= \frac{\partial P(S, K, \sigma, r, T-t, \delta)}{\partial \sigma}   = \text{ Call vega}
\end{aligned}
$$

<br>

It is common to report vega as the change in the option price per percentage point change in the volatility. This requires dividing the vega formula above by 100.


## Appendix 12.B: Formulas for Option Greeks (cont'd)

<br>

### **Rho** ($\rho$)

Rho is the partial derivative of the option price with respect to the interest rate:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Call rho } &= \frac{\partial C(S, K, \sigma, r, T - t, \delta)}{\partial r} =  (T - t) K e^{-r (T - t)} N(d_{2}) \\
\text{Put  rho } &= \frac{\partial P(S, K, \sigma, r, T - t, \delta)}{\partial r} = -(T - t) K e^{-r (T - t)} N(-d_{2})
\end{aligned}
$$

These expressions for rho assume a change in $r$ of 1.0. We are typically interested in evaluating the effect of a change of 0.01 (100 basis points) or 0.0001 (1 basis point). To report rho as a change per percentage point in the interest rate, divide this measure by 100. To interpret it as a change per basis point, divide by 10,000.


## Appendix 12.B: Formulas for Option Greeks (cont'd)

<br>

### **Psi** ($\psi$)

<br>

Psi is the partial derivative of the option price with respect to the continuous dividend yield:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Call psi } &= \frac{\partial C(S, K, \sigma, r, T - t, \delta)}{\partial \delta} = -(T - t) S e^{-\delta (T - t)} N(d_{1}) \\
\text{Put  psi } &= \frac{\partial P(S, K, \sigma, r, T - t, \delta)}{\partial \delta} =  (T - t) S e^{-\delta (T - t)} N(-d_{1})
\end{aligned}
$$

To interpret psi as a price change per percentage point change in the dividend yield, divide by 100.
